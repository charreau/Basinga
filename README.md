# Basinga
We develop a new and freely available GIS toolbox named Basinga which calculates, based on the Lal/Stone and LSD models, the scaling factors, production and denudation rates over multiple drainage basins. This tool also provides several options to correct for topographic shielding, ice cover, lithology and an original approach to account for paleomagnetic changes.
